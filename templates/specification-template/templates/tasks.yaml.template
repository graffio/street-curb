        - Replace this list with concrete steps. Reference specific sections like "Section â†’ Subsection" in the architecture docs.
        - Keep instructions declarative and avoid long code blocks; link to canonical helpers instead.
        - Mention required files or modules (e.g., `modules/foo/src/bar.js`).

      - "State measurable outcomes that prove the task is done"
