template_structure:
  required_files:
    - background.md: "Concise overview, references, and phase outline"
    - tasks.yaml: "Executable task list with implementation, validation, tests"
  optional_files:
    - meta.yaml: "Specification metadata (only when automation requires it)"
    - llm-loader.md: "Custom loader if extra context needed"

template_usage:
  - Copy only the files you intend to fill (`background.md.template`, `tasks.yaml.template`)
  - Rename them and replace {{PLACEHOLDERS}} with project-specific content
  - Link to docs/architecture/ for deep technical detail; do not duplicate long snippets
  - Capture implementation steps and validation directly inside `tasks.yaml`

architecture_integration:
  - Reference docs/architecture/ files rather than embedding content
  - Link to specific architectural decisions
  - Keep implementation-focused content in specification
  - Maintain separation of concerns

task_management:
  - Break work into specific, executable tasks
  - Include validation criteria for each task
  - Track dependencies between tasks
  - Use human-readable task descriptions
