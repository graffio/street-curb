## ‚úÖ DECIDED

### Core Architecture

- **App Name**: CurbMap
- **Architecture**: Event sourcing with Firestore queue + giant function
- **Data Model**: Organizations + Projects hierarchy with event scoping
- **Authentication**: Passcode-only, no anonymous users
- **Environments**: `curb-map-development`, `curb-map-staging`, `curb-map-production`

### Technical Stack

- **Error Monitoring**: Sentry.io (better developer experience, superior error grouping)
- **CI/CD Platform**: GitLab (user familiarity, built-in CI/CD, container registry)
- **Billing Strategy**: Single account with project labels for cost tracking
- **Database**: Firestore for events, materialized views for performance
- **Infrastructure**: Firebase + GCP services

### Terminology & Data Model

- **Organizations**: Use "organizations" instead of "cities" (more scalable)
- **Members**: Use "members" instead of "users" (clearer role distinction)
- **Field Naming**: camelCase, never abbreviate, always include "Id" suffix for IDs
- **Event Sourcing**: All changes stored as immutable events, current state calculated
- **Multi-Project**: Design for multiple projects per org, start with default project

## Architecture References

- **Security & Compliance**: See `docs/architecture/security.md` for SOC2, audit logging, and compliance decisions
- **Data Model**: See `docs/architecture/data-model.md` for event sourcing and data isolation patterns
- **Deployment**: See `docs/architecture/deployment.md` for environment strategy and infrastructure decisions

## üìê ARCHITECTURE DECISION RECORDS (ADRs)

### Data Model Architecture Decisions

<a id="hybrid-collections"></a>

#### Hybrid Collection Strategy

**Decision**: Use flat collections for event source and top-level entities (organizations, users), hierarchical
collections for projects and domain data.

**Date**: 2024-11 to 2025-01
**Status**: Implemented

**Problem**: Need to support both cross-organization queries (for admin/support staff) AND complete data isolation (for
multi-tenant security).

**Solution**:

- **Flat collections**: `/completedActions/{id}`, `/organizations/{id}`, `/users/{id}` with `organizationId` field
- **Hierarchical collections**: `/organizations/{orgId}/projects/{projId}`,
  `/organizations/{orgId}/projects/{projId}/surveys/{id}`

**Benefits**:

- Cross-org queries enabled (SOC2 audit reports, admin queries)
- Data isolation enforced via Firestore rules (hierarchical paths)
- Best of both patterns

**Trade-offs**:

- Two patterns to learn (cognitive load)
- More complex than pure flat or pure hierarchical

**Alternatives Considered**:

- Pure flat structure - Rejected (harder to enforce data isolation)
- Pure hierarchical structure - Rejected (cross-org queries impossible)

---

<a id="flat-event-source"></a>

#### Flat Event Source

**Decision**: Store `completedActions` as flat collection with `organizationId` field (not hierarchical under
organizations).

**Date**: 2024-11
**Status**: Implemented

**Problem**: SOC2 compliance requires cross-organization audit queries ("show all actions by user X across all
organizations").

**Solution**: Flat collection with organizational scoping via fields:

```
/completedActions/{id}
{
  id: "acr_123",
  organizationId: "org_abc",  // Field, not path hierarchy
  action: {...},
  actorId: "usr_xyz"
}
```

**Benefits**:

- Cross-org audit queries: `where('actorId', '==', userId)`
- SOC2 compliance reports
- Support staff can debug across organizations

**Trade-offs**:

- Firestore rules must check `organizationId` field (not path-based)

**Alternatives Considered**:

- Hierarchical under organizations - Rejected (can't query across orgs)
- Separate audit collection per org - Rejected (compliance nightmare)

---

<a id="default-project-pattern"></a>

#### Default Project Pattern

**Decision**: Auto-create default project with real CUID2 ID when organization is created.

**Date**: 2024-11
**Status**: Implemented

**Problem**: Need to support single project now, multiple projects later, without data migration.

**Solution**: Every organization gets `defaultProjectId` field pointing to auto-created project with real CUID2:

```
organizations/{org_xyz}:
  defaultProjectId: "prj_abc123"  // Real CUID2, not "default" magic string

organizations/{org_xyz}/projects/{prj_abc123}:
  name: "Default Project"
```

**Benefits**:

- No migration needed when ProjectCreated actions added
- No query rewrites required
- Consistent ID format (all projects use CUID2)

**Trade-offs**:

- Slight storage overhead (1 project doc per org)
- Small complexity now vs massive migration later

**Cost Analysis**:

- Migration cost avoided: 20-40+ hours
- Implementation cost: Already done (OrganizationCreated handler)

**Alternatives Considered**:

- Magic string "default" - Rejected (inconsistent with CUID2 pattern)
- No default project - Rejected (UX complexity)
- Flat structure with migration later - Rejected (too risky/expensive)

---

<a id="metadata-fields"></a>

#### Metadata on Every Document

**Decision**: Add `createdAt`, `createdBy`, `updatedAt`, `updatedBy` to all domain documents, populated by server (not
client).

**Date**: 2024-11
**Status**: Implemented

**Problem**: Need audit trail for who changed what when, prevent client timestamp spoofing.

**Solution**: Event handlers add metadata fields from `actionRequest.actorId` and `serverTimestamp()`:

```
{
  // Domain fields
  name: "City of SF",

  // Metadata (added by handler, NOT in Action payload)
  createdAt: serverTimestamp(),
  createdBy: "usr_abc",  // from actionRequest.actorId
  updatedAt: serverTimestamp(),
  updatedBy: "usr_abc"
}
```

**Benefits**:

- Server-authoritative timestamps (can't be spoofed)
- Fast queries without joining events
- Actor attribution for compliance

**Trade-offs**:

- Data duplication (metadata in both completedActions and domain docs)
- Clients can't provide these fields (would be rejected)

**Implementation**: Action payloads never include metadata fields. Handlers add them programmatically.

**Alternatives Considered**:

- Client-provided timestamps - Rejected (security risk)
- No metadata on domain docs - Rejected (slow queries)
- Metadata only in completedActions - Rejected (requires event replay)

---

<a id="organization-scoped-rbac"></a>

#### Organization-Scoped RBAC

**Decision**: User roles are scoped per organization, stored in `users.organizations` map and Firebase Auth custom
claims.

**Date**: 2024-11 to 2025-01
**Status**: Implemented

**Problem**: Users need different roles in different organizations (consultant admin in SF, member in LA).

**Solution**: Store roles as map in user document + Firebase Auth custom claims:

```
// Firestore /users/{userId}
{
  organizations: {
    "org_sf": "admin",
    "org_la": "member"
  }
}

// Firebase Auth custom claims
{
  organizations: {
    "org_sf": { role: "admin", joinedAt: "2025-01-15" }
  }
}
```

**Benefits**:

- User can have different roles in different orgs
- Fast authorization via token claims (no DB lookup)
- Supports consultants, support staff, multi-org users

**Trade-offs**:

- Custom claims size limit (~1KB, supports ~10 orgs per user)
- Claims don't update until token refresh

**Roles** (MVP): `admin` > `member` > `viewer` (simple role hierarchy)

**Future**: Granular permissions (e.g., `projects:write`, `users:manage`) will replace role enums.

**Alternatives Considered**:

- Global roles - Rejected (no multi-tenant support)
- Separate user per org - Rejected (UX nightmare)
- Database-only (no custom claims) - Rejected (slower authorization)

### Implementation Decisions

<a id="http-functions-vs-triggers"></a>

#### HTTP Functions vs Firestore Triggers

**Decision**: Use HTTP Cloud Functions as entry point for all client actions, not Firestore triggers.

**Date**: January 2025
**Specification**: F110.7 - HTTP Action Submission

**Problem**: Original F108/F110 design used Firestore document triggers where client writes ActionRequest to Firestore,
then onDocumentWritten trigger fires. Issues:

- Malformed data can be written to database
- Validation happens AFTER write (audit trail pollution)
- Client gets no immediate feedback on validation errors
- Firestore security rules can't express complex validation logic

**Solution**: HTTP Cloud Functions with validation before database write:

```
Client calls HTTP function with Action payload
  ‚Üì
HTTP function validates request
  ‚Üì (if invalid)
Returns HTTP 400 with error message (no DB write)
  ‚Üì (if valid)
Processes action ‚Üí writes to completedActions
  ‚Üì
Returns HTTP 200 with success response
```

**Benefits**:

1. Validation before database write - Cleaner audit trail
2. Synchronous error responses - Better client UX
3. Better security - Server is gatekeeper
4. Simpler architecture - One less collection (`actionRequests` removed)

**Trade-offs**:

- Requires offline queue for mobile apps (deferred to backlog)
- Web app is online-only (acceptable for desk workers)
- Breaking change - clients must call HTTP function instead of writing to Firestore

**Alternatives Considered**:

- Keep Firestore triggers - Rejected due to validation issues
- Hybrid approach - Rejected for complexity
- Client-side validation only - Rejected for security reasons

---

<a id="transaction-based-idempotency"></a>

#### Transaction-Based Idempotency

**Decision**: Use Firestore transactions for atomic duplicate detection and single write as "completed".

**Date**: January 2025
**Specification**: F110.8 - Transaction-Based Idempotency

**Problem**: Current implementation violated SOC2 audit log immutability by writing "pending" ‚Üí updating to "completed".
Issues:

- Mutates audit trail (SOC2 violation)
- Race conditions in duplicate detection
- Complex error handling for partial states

**Solution**: Transaction-based single write:

```javascript
await db.runTransaction(async tx => {
    // Atomic duplicate check
    const existing = await txContext.completedActions.readOrNull(actionRequest.id)
    if (existing) return { duplicate: true, processedAt: existing.processedAt }
    
    // Process action
    await handler(logger, txContext, actionRequest)
    
    // Single write as "completed"
    await txContext.completedActions.create(actionRequest)
    
    return { duplicate: false }
})
```

**Benefits**:

- Atomic duplicate detection and write (no race conditions)
- Immutable audit trail (SOC2 compliant)
- Crash-safe (all or nothing)
- Simpler code (one path, not two)

**Trade-offs**:

- Requires Firestore transactions (more complex than simple check-then-write)
- Breaking change - HTTP 409 for duplicates instead of HTTP 200 + duplicate flag
- Server timestamps required (more complex than client timestamps)

**Alternatives Considered**:

- Keep write-first pattern - Rejected for SOC2 compliance
- Separate idempotency collection - Rejected for complexity
- Client-side duplicate prevention - Rejected for reliability

<a id="materialized-views"></a>

#### Materialized Views Architecture

**Decision**: Handlers write directly to domain collections, eliminating need for separate materialized views.

**Date**: January 2025
**Specification**: F110.6 - Materialized Views (OBSOLETE)

**Original Plan**: Create separate materialized views by listening to `completedActions`:

```
completedActions ‚Üí Trigger ‚Üí Build views ‚Üí Queryable collections
```

**Actual Implementation**: F110 handlers write final state directly to domain collections:

```
HTTP Function ‚Üí Validates ‚Üí Processes ‚Üí Writes to domain collections + completedActions
```

**Collections Written by Handlers**:

- `/organizations/{id}` - Written by OrganizationCreated/Updated/Suspended handlers
- `/users/{id}` - Written by UserCreated/Updated/Deleted/Forgotten/RoleAssigned handlers
- `/organizations/{orgId}/projects/{id}` - Written by OrganizationCreated handler (default project)

**Benefits**:

- No lag between action completion and view availability
- Simpler architecture with fewer moving parts
- Immediately queryable - UI queries these collections directly
- Source of truth - No separate "view building" step needed

**Result**: F110.6 (Materialized Views) became obsolete - the functionality is already built into F110 handlers.

**Future Considerations**: Separate materialized views might be needed for:

1. Complex aggregations across organizations
2. Cross-organization analytics
3. Performance optimization for specific query patterns

<a id="authentication-authorization"></a>

#### Authentication & Authorization

**Decision**: Use Firestore security rules for authorization, not middleware.

**Date**: January 2025
**Specification**: F110.5 - Authentication & Authorization

**Problem**: Need to implement authentication and authorization for multi-tenant system.

**Solution**:

- **Authentication**: Firebase Auth with passcode authentication
- **Authorization**: Firestore security rules (not middleware)

**Benefits**:

- Simpler architecture - Security rules handle authorization
- Better performance - No middleware overhead
- Firebase native - Leverages Firebase's security model
- Organization-scoped - Rules can check custom claims

**Trade-offs**:

- Less flexible than middleware approach
- Firebase-specific - Tied to Firestore security rules
- Complex rules - Security rules can be hard to debug

**Alternatives Considered**:

- Authorization middleware - Rejected for complexity
- API Gateway - Rejected for over-engineering
- Custom auth system - Rejected for maintenance burden

---

<a id="organization-members-map"></a>

#### Organization Members Map

**Decision**: Store organization members as map in organization document (not subcollection).

**Date**: October 2025

**Problem**: Org admins need member list visibility, and UI needs to display "Sam Chen edited this curb" even after Sam
removed (querying completedActions for every actor name would be expensive).

**Solution**: Bidirectional membership with soft delete - `organization.members` map (with `removedAt`/`removedBy`
fields) + `user.organizations` map. Single O(1) read for member list, preserves names for UI history.

**Key Points**:

- MemberRemoved: Single org, sets `removedAt`
- UserForgotten: All orgs, GDPR compliant
- Fits municipal scale (50-500 members, under 1MB limit)
- Dual writes on member operations

**Details**: See [data-model.md](architecture/data-model.md#domain-collections) for schema
and [security.md](architecture/security.md#firestore-security-rules) for access control.

**Alternatives Rejected**: Subcollection (over-engineered), query `/users` (security), user data only (no visibility)
