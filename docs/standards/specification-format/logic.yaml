spec_format:
  required_files:
    - meta.yaml
    - llm-loader.md
    - logic.yaml

files:
  meta.yaml: "Spec metadata (spec_id, name, description, file roles)"
  llm-loader.md: "Quick loader instructions (keep brief, reference this logic)"
  logic.yaml: "Structure and rules"

spec_rules:
  - Specs must list required files in meta.yaml with their roles
  - Specs must be loadable without external context
  - Tasks must have IDs following task_X_Y_description pattern
  - Task-level specs must include an execution_status section (current/pending/completed)
  - Changes should be small, independent, and rollback-friendly
  - Reference docs/architecture/ for reusable patterns rather than duplicating architecture

notes:
  - templates/specification-template/ provides a copy-ready template that satisfies these rules
  - Additional validation (tests) can be defined by individual specs if needed
