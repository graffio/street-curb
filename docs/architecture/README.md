# Architecture Documentation

This directory contains enduring architectural patterns, decisions, and designs for the graffio-monorepo system.

## Purpose

- **Separation of Concerns**: Keep architectural context separate from implementation specifications
- **Reusability**: Architectural patterns can be referenced by multiple specifications
- **Maintainability**: Easier to keep architectural context current and consistent
- **Reference Source**: Single source of truth for architectural decisions

## File Organization

- `authentication.md` - Authentication patterns, security models, and access control
- `deployment.md` - Deployment architecture, environments, and infrastructure
- `data-model.md` - Data modeling patterns, event sourcing, and database design
- `security.md` - Security architecture, compliance, and audit patterns
- `event-sourcing.md` - Event sourcing patterns, queue processing, and idempotency
- `queue-mechanism.md` - Offline queue processing, conflict resolution, and retry logic
- `offline-first.md` - Offline-first design patterns, connection management, and sync strategies
- `multi-tenant.md` - Organization hierarchy, data isolation, and RBAC patterns
- `billing-integration.md` - Billing integration, webhook processing, and data export patterns

## Usage

### For Specifications
Reference architectural context in specifications rather than embedding it:

```markdown
## Security Architecture
See `docs/architecture/security.md` for authentication patterns and access control.

## Data Model
See `docs/architecture/data-model.md` for event sourcing patterns and data structures.
```

### For Implementation
Use architectural patterns as guidance for implementation decisions:

- Check relevant architecture docs before making design decisions
- Reference architectural decisions in implementation rationale
- Update architecture docs when patterns evolve

## Ownership

- **Primary Maintainer**: {{MAINTAINER_NAME}}
- **Review Cycle**: Quarterly review to ensure patterns remain current
- **Update Process**: Update when architectural decisions change or new patterns emerge

## Linking to Specifications

Architecture docs should reference the specifications that implement them:

```markdown
## Implementations
- **F107**: Firebase SOC2 implementation - see `specifications/F107-firebase-soc2-vanilla-app/`
- **F200**: Lookup table migration - see `specifications/F200-lookuptable-blockface-migration/`
```

## Maintenance

- Keep architectural content current with implementation reality
- Remove outdated patterns and decisions
- Add new patterns as they emerge
- Ensure all references to architecture docs remain valid
