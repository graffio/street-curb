# Incident Response

**Security Incident Procedures**

## Executive Summary

CurbMap's incident response leverages service account impersonation for rapid access revocation (< 5 minutes).
Short-lived credentials limit breach exposure, and comprehensive audit logs enable investigation. This document covers 5
incident types with response times and procedures.

**Priority Levels:**

- **P0 (< 5 min):** Compromised account with production access, unauthorized data access
- **P1 (< 1 hour):** Suspicious production activity, unauthorized config changes
- **P2 (< 4 hours):** Policy violations, after-hours deployments
- **P3 (< 24 hours):** Access review findings, permission cleanup

**Critical Commands:**

```bash
# Immediate revocation (< 5 minutes)
for project in curb-map-{development,staging,production}; do
  gcloud iam service-accounts remove-iam-policy-binding \
    firebase-infrastructure-sa@${project}.iam.gserviceaccount.com \
    --member="user:compromised@company.com" \
    --role="roles/iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator" \
    --project=$project
done

# Verify revocation
gcloud iam service-accounts get-iam-policy \
  firebase-infrastructure-sa@curb-map-production.iam.gserviceaccount.com

# Investigate recent activity
gcloud logging read '
  protoPayload.authenticationInfo.principalEmail="compromised@company.com"
  AND timestamp>="'$(date -u -d '7 days ago' +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)'"
' --format=json > incident-logs-$(date +%Y-%m-%d).json
```

## Incident Types

### 1. Compromised Developer Account

**Indicators:**

- Unusual activity in audit logs
- User reports suspicious emails/logins
- Failed MFA attempts
- Access from unusual locations

**Immediate Actions (< 5 minutes):**

```bash
# 1. Revoke impersonation permissions immediately
for project in curb-map-{development,staging,production}; do
  gcloud iam service-accounts remove-iam-policy-binding \
    firebase-infrastructure-sa@${project}.iam.gserviceaccount.com \
    --member="user:compromised@company.com" \
    --role="roles/iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator" \
    --project=$project
done

# 2. Verify revocation
gcloud iam service-accounts get-iam-policy \
  firebase-infrastructure-sa@curb-map-production.iam.gserviceaccount.com
```

**Investigation (< 1 hour):**

```bash
# 3. Query audit logs for all actions by compromised account
gcloud logging read '
  protoPayload.authenticationInfo.principalEmail="compromised@company.com"
  AND timestamp>="'$(date -u -d '7 days ago' +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)'"
' --format=json > incident-logs-$(date +%Y-%m-%d).json

# 4. Review what was accessed/modified
cat incident-logs-*.json | jq '.[] | {
  timestamp: .timestamp,
  method: .protoPayload.methodName,
  resource: .protoPayload.resourceName,
  result: .protoPayload.status.code
}'
```

**Recovery Actions:**

1. Reset user password (Google Workspace)
2. Verify MFA enrollment still active
3. Review changes made during compromise period
4. Rollback unauthorized changes if any
5. Document incident with timeline
6. Re-grant access after verification user account is secure

**Recovery Time:** Access revoked < 5 min, full investigation < 4 hours

---

### 2. Unauthorized Access Attempt

**Indicators:**

- Permission denied errors for unfamiliar users
- Failed impersonation attempts
- Unexpected IAM policy changes

**Immediate Actions:**

```bash
# 1. Check who attempted access
gcloud logging read '
  protoPayload.status.code!=0
  AND protoPayload.methodName:"generateAccessToken"
' --limit 100

# 2. Verify IAM policies haven't been modified
gcloud logging read '
  protoPayload.methodName:"SetIamPolicy"
  AND timestamp>="'$(date -u -d '24 hours ago' +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)'"
'
```

**Investigation:**

1. Identify user attempting access
2. Check if legitimate (new employee, misconfiguration)
3. If illegitimate: Investigate how they attempted access
4. Review org-wide IAM policies for misconfigurations

**Recovery Actions:**

- If legitimate: Grant proper permissions
- If illegitimate: Alert security team, investigate breach vector

**Recovery Time:** Investigation < 2 hours

---

### 3. Suspicious Production Activity

**Indicators:**

- After-hours deployments without justification
- Unusual resource modifications
- Multiple rapid deployments
- Deployment by unauthorized user

**Immediate Actions:**

```bash
# 1. Query production audit logs for recent activity
gcloud logging read '
  resource.labels.project_id="curb-map-production"
  AND timestamp>="'$(date -u -d '1 hour ago' +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)'"
' --format=json

# 2. Identify who made changes
jq -r '.[] | .protoPayload.authenticationInfo.principalEmail' | sort -u

# 3. Review what was changed
jq '.[] | {user: .protoPayload.authenticationInfo.principalEmail, method: .protoPayload.methodName, resource: .protoPayload.resourceName}'
```

**Investigation:**

1. Contact user who made changes
2. Verify authorization for changes
3. Check change management tickets/approvals
4. Review changes for correctness/safety

**Recovery Actions:**

- If authorized: Document justification
- If unauthorized: Rollback changes, revoke access, investigate

**Recovery Time:** Contact user < 15 min, investigation < 1 hour

---

### 4. Employee Departure

**Indicators:**

- HR notification of termination
- Planned resignation

**Immediate Actions (Same Day):**

```bash
EMAIL="departing@company.com"

# 1. Revoke all access
for project in curb-map-{development,staging,production}; do
  echo "Revoking access from $project..."
  gcloud iam service-accounts remove-iam-policy-binding \
    firebase-infrastructure-sa@${project}.iam.gserviceaccount.com \
    --member="user:$EMAIL" \
    --role="roles/iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator" \
    --project=$project
done

# 2. Verify revocation
for project in curb-map-{development,staging,production}; do
  gcloud iam service-accounts get-iam-policy \
    firebase-infrastructure-sa@${project}.iam.gserviceaccount.com \
    --project=$project | grep "$EMAIL" && echo "WARNING: Still has access to $project" || echo "âœ“ No access to $project"
done
```

**Follow-up Actions:**

```bash
# 3. Review recent activity (last 30 days)
gcloud logging read '
  protoPayload.authenticationInfo.principalEmail="departing@company.com"
  AND timestamp>="'$(date -u -d '30 days ago' +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)'"

## Incident Response Workflow

### 1. Detection

**Automated Alerts:**

- After-hours production deployment
- New user accessing production
- Multiple failed permission attempts
- IAM policy changes

**Manual Detection:**

- Quarterly access review finds anomalies
- User reports suspicious activity
- Manager notices unauthorized changes

### 2. Triage

**Priority Levels:**

- **P0 (< 5 min):** Compromised account with production access, unauthorized data access, active security breach
- **P1 (< 1 hour):** Suspicious production activity, unauthorized configuration changes, failed breach attempt
- **P2 (< 4 hours):** Policy violations, after-hours deployments without justification, unusual access patterns
- **P3 (< 24 hours):** Access review findings, cleanup of old permissions, documentation updates

### 3. Response

**Incident Commander:** CTO or designated security lead
**Authority:** Revoke access immediately, coordinate investigation, communicate with stakeholders

**Technical Response:**

- Revoke access as needed
- Query audit logs
- Assess damage
- Implement fixes

**Communication:**

- Notify affected users
- Update management
- Document in incident tracker
- Post-incident review

### 4. Recovery

**Immediate (< 5 min):** Revoke compromised access, verify revocation effective

**Short-term (< 4 hours):** Investigate full scope, rollback unauthorized changes, restore to known good state

**Long-term:** Root cause analysis, improve detection/prevention, update procedures, security training

### 5. Post-Incident

**Documentation:**

- Incident timeline
- Actions taken
- Damage assessment
- Root cause
- Prevention measures

**Review:**

- What worked well?
- What could be improved?
- Update runbooks
- Share lessons learned

**Evidence Retention:** Audit log exports, incident documentation, communication records (retain 7 years for SOC2
compliance)

## Testing & Drills

### Annual Security Drill

**Scenario:** Simulated compromised account

**Process:**

1. Randomly select a developer account
2. Security team "compromises" account (with their knowledge)
3. Detection systems should alert
4. Incident Commander responds per runbook
5. Access revoked and investigation performed
6. Measure response times
7. Review and improve procedures

**Success Criteria:**

- Detection within target time
- Access revoked < 5 minutes
- Complete investigation < 4 hours
- Lessons learned documented

**Frequency:** Annually + after major changes
