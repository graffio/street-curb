# Compliance Roadmap

**SOC2 Implementation Timeline**

## Executive Summary

CurbMap's path to SOC2 compliance follows a three-phase approach: Foundation (manual setup + impersonation), Operational
Hardening (access reviews + incident response), and Continuous Compliance (automated reporting + monitoring). Full
readiness expected in 6-12 months.

**Current Status:** Phase 1 - Foundation (90% complete)

**Key Milestones:**

- âœ… Service account impersonation implemented (no key files)
- âœ… Documentation complete (authentication, access, audit, controls)
- ðŸ”„ Manual setup guide ready (awaiting first production setup)
- ðŸ“‹ Access review process defined (ready to implement)
- ðŸ“‹ Incident response procedures documented (ready to test)
