## Superpowers Integration

This project uses [Superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers) for AI-assisted development workflows.

**Key workflows**:
- `/superpowers:brainstorm` — Design refinement through Socratic questioning
- `/superpowers:write-plan` — Create implementation plans with bite-sized tasks
- `/superpowers:execute-plan` — Execute plans in batches with review checkpoints

**Skills activate automatically** when relevant (test-driven development, systematic debugging, verification before completion, etc.)

Superpowers handles subagent dispatch, code review, and parallel task execution.
