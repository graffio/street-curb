# Multi-Agent Workflow System

See `.claude/commands/workflow.md` for the complete workflow system documentation.

**Note**: This file references the main workflow documentation in `.claude/commands/workflow.md` for compatibility with both Claude Code and Cursor. Both systems use the same workflow commands and agent system.
