# Implement Feature (TDD)

Test-driven development. No exceptions.

## Steps

1. **Write failing test** - Validates the desired functionality
2. **Run test** - Confirm it fails as expected
3. **Write minimal code** - Only enough to make test pass
4. **Run test** - Confirm it passes
5. **Refactor** - Clean up while keeping tests green

## Rules

- Never write implementation before test
- Each cycle should be small (minutes, not hours)
- If stuck on test, the feature may need clearer definition—ask Jeff
