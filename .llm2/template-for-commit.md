{{Why: one sentence explaining the driver for the change}}

- {{Change summary #1}} # duplicate this block for additional summaries
    - {{file-path-1.js}}
    - ...
    - {{file-path-N.js}}  # repeat as needed

Prompt reference: {{YYYY-MM-DD description (.llm2/prompts/<file>.md)}}


Just duplicate the indented - {{file-path…}} line for every file that contributes to that bullet. If a change spans many files, group them under whichever summary makes sense (or add
another summary bullet).
