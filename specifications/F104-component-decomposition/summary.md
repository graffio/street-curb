# F104 Component Decomposition Summary

**Date:** 2025.07.29  
**Purpose:** Break down monolithic SegmentedCurbEditor into focused, maintainable components

## Core Decision
Decompose 700+ line SegmentedCurbEditor into 4-5 specialized components:
- **Main container** - Orchestration and state management only (100-150 lines)
- **SegmentRenderer** - Visual segment rendering and basic interactions
- **DragDropHandler** - Drag and drop operations with mobile/desktop support
- **LabelLayer** - Label positioning and dropdown interactions
- **DividerLayer** - Segment boundary resizing handles

## Key Constraints
- **No behavior changes** - Maintain exact current functionality during decomposition
- **Redux integration** - All components connect to same Redux store patterns
- **Mobile support** - Preserve existing touch/mouse event handling
- **Testing** - Each component must be unit testable in isolation
- **Step-by-step** - Extract one component per commit for safe rollback

## Success Criteria
- [ ] SegmentedCurbEditor reduced from 700+ to 100-150 lines
- [ ] Each new component has single clear responsibility
- [ ] All existing functionality preserved (drag, resize, labels, mobile)
- [ ] Components can be tested independently
- [ ] No performance regressions in drag operations
