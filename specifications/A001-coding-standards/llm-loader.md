# LLM Loader for A001 â€“ JavaScript Functional Coding Standards

**CRITICAL**: Read and follow these coding standards before writing ANY code in this project.

This specification defines the mandatory functional JavaScript coding standards for the entire codebase, with strict anti-TypeScript stance and emphasis on pure functional programming patterns.

## Load Order
1. `meta.yaml`: Provides spec metadata and file roles
2. `logic.yaml`: Defines all coding rules, patterns, and constraints in structured format
3. `tests.yaml`: Optional validation examples showing compliant vs non-compliant code

**WARNING**: Ignoring these standards will result in code that violates project architecture. All code must be reviewed against logic.yaml requirements.
