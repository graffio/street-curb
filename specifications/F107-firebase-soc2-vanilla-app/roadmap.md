# CurbMap Implementation Roadmap

**6-week implementation sequence with clear dependencies and deliverables**

## Week 1: Infrastructure Foundation
**Goal**: Set up development environment and basic project provisioning

### Deliverables
- [ ] `createSOC2Project()` function working
- [ ] Three environments created: `curb-map-development`, `curb-map-staging`, `curb-map-production`
- [ ] GitLab CI/CD pipeline configured
- [ ] Basic Firebase services enabled (Auth, Firestore, Functions, Hosting)

### Key Files
- **`phase1-infrastructure.md`** - Detailed implementation steps
- **`architecture.md`** - Environment configuration patterns

### Dependencies
- None (starting point)

### Success Criteria
- Can create new projects programmatically
- CI/CD pipeline deploys to staging
- All environments properly configured

---

## Week 2: Event Sourcing Core
**Goal**: Implement core event sourcing pattern with queue processing

### Deliverables
- [ ] Firestore queue collection with proper rules
- [ ] Giant function for event processing
- [ ] Basic event types: `UserCreated`, `UserUpdated`, `UserForgotten`
- [ ] Idempotency handling with UUIDs
- [ ] Events collection with proper structure

### Key Files
- **`phase2-events.md`** - Event sourcing implementation
- **`architecture.md`** - Data model and security patterns

### Dependencies
- Week 1 complete (infrastructure ready)

### Success Criteria
- Can create events via queue
- Idempotency prevents duplicate processing
- Events stored immutably with proper structure

---

## Week 3: Authentication System
**Goal**: Implement passcode-only authentication with organization roles

### Deliverables
- [ ] Firebase Auth configured for passcode-only
- [ ] Custom claims for organization roles
- [ ] Impersonation feature for support
- [ ] Security middleware for API endpoints
- [ ] User management API endpoints

### Key Files
- **`phase3-auth.md`** - Authentication implementation
- **`architecture.md`** - Security model patterns

### Dependencies
- Week 2 complete (event sourcing foundation)

### Success Criteria
- Users can authenticate with passcodes
- Role-based permissions working
- Impersonation feature functional
- All API endpoints properly secured

---

## Week 4: Multi-Tenant Data Model
**Goal**: Implement organization + project hierarchy with data isolation

### Deliverables
- [ ] Organization management (CRUD operations)
- [ ] Project management (CRUD operations)
- [ ] Materialized view generation from events
- [ ] Data isolation middleware
- [ ] Role-based permissions system

### Key Files
- **`phase4-multitenant.md`** - Multi-tenant implementation
- **`architecture.md`** - Data model patterns

### Dependencies
- Week 3 complete (authentication system)

### Success Criteria
- Organizations and projects can be created/managed
- Data properly isolated between organizations
- Materialized views stay in sync with events
- Permissions work correctly

---

## Week 5: Offline Queue Architecture
**Goal**: Implement offline-capable client operations with sync

### Deliverables
- [ ] Client-side queue operations
- [ ] Offline sync handling
- [ ] Conflict resolution mechanisms
- [ ] Real-time status updates
- [ ] Error handling and retry logic

### Key Files
- **`phase5-offline.md`** - Offline queue implementation
- **`architecture.md`** - Queue processing patterns

### Dependencies
- Week 4 complete (multi-tenant data model)

### Success Criteria
- Client works offline and syncs when online
- Conflicts resolved properly
- Users get real-time feedback on operations
- Error handling works correctly

---

## Week 6: Billing & Export
**Goal**: Implement billing integration and data export capabilities

### Deliverables
- [ ] Stripe integration for annual billing
- [ ] Multi-format data export (JSON, CSV, CDS)
- [ ] Usage tracking and reporting
- [ ] Invoice generation
- [ ] Webhook handling for billing events

### Key Files
- **`phase6-billing.md`** - Billing and export implementation
- **`architecture.md`** - Integration patterns

### Dependencies
- Week 5 complete (offline queue architecture)

### Success Criteria
- Billing system functional
- Data exports working in all formats
- Usage properly tracked
- Webhooks processing correctly

---

## Implementation Strategy

### Daily Workflow
1. **Morning**: Review current phase goals and dependencies
2. **Development**: Follow phase-specific implementation guide
3. **Testing**: Verify success criteria for current phase
4. **Documentation**: Update progress and any issues encountered

### Quality Gates
- **End of each week**: All deliverables complete and tested
- **Dependencies**: Cannot start next phase until current phase complete
- **Rollback**: Keep previous phase working while implementing next

### Risk Mitigation
- **Parallel work**: Some tasks can be done in parallel within a phase
- **Early testing**: Test integration points early in each phase
- **Documentation**: Keep implementation notes for future reference

### Success Metrics
- **Week 1**: Infrastructure provisioning automated
- **Week 2**: Event sourcing pattern working
- **Week 3**: Authentication system secure and functional
- **Week 4**: Multi-tenant data isolation working
- **Week 5**: Offline capabilities functional
- **Week 6**: Billing and export systems operational

## Post-Implementation
