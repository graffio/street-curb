- Event sourcing scoped to org_id + project_id hierarchy ✅
- Future: Different feature sets per application
- **Status**: Core data model supports multiple projects with "default" project for MVP

**Timeline**: Multi-project data model implemented upfront, UI for multiple projects when 20% of customers request

### Marketplace/Partner Ecosystem
**Future Question**: Third-party integrations and marketplace?
- Partner-built extensions
- Revenue sharing models
- **Impact**: API versioning, security delegation

**Timeline**: When we have 100+ customers with integration requests

### Advanced Billing Models
**Future Question**: Usage-based billing vs fixed annual?
- Per-user pricing
- Feature-based tiers
- API call metering
- **Impact**: Complex usage tracking and billing logic

**Timeline**: When current model limits growth

## Technical Infrastructure

### ✅ Event Sourcing Architecture - IMPLEMENTED
**Decision Made**: Implementing event sourcing from day 1
- Complete audit trail by design ✅
- Time-travel debugging capabilities ✅ 
- CCPA/GDPR compliance via UserForgotten events ✅
- **Status**: Core architectural decision, implemented in queue + event pattern

### GraphQL API Layer
**Future Question**: Should we expose GraphQL instead of REST?
- Better client developer experience
- Efficient data fetching
- **Impact**: Additional API layer, caching complexity

**Timeline**: When we have mobile apps or complex client requirements

### Real-Time Collaboration
**Future Question**: Should we support real-time collaborative editing?
- Multiple users editing same data
- Conflict resolution
- **Impact**: Complex state synchronization

**Timeline**: When customers request collaborative workflows

### Advanced Analytics Platform
**Future Question**: Should we build customer-facing analytics?
- Business intelligence for customers
- Custom reporting and dashboards
- **Impact**: OLAP database, visualization tools

**Timeline**: When customers request reporting beyond basic exports

## Operational Excellence

### Chaos Engineering
**Future Question**: Should we implement chaos engineering practices?
- Proactive reliability testing
- Failure scenario validation
- **Impact**: Additional testing infrastructure and processes

**Timeline**: When uptime SLA becomes critical business requirement

### Advanced Monitoring & Observability
**Future Question**: Should we implement distributed tracing?
- End-to-end request tracking
- Performance bottleneck identification
- **Impact**: Additional complexity in logging and monitoring

**Timeline**: When performance debugging becomes difficult

### Disaster Recovery Automation
**Future Question**: Should we automate disaster recovery testing?
- Regular backup restoration testing
- Automated failover procedures
- **Impact**: Complex orchestration and testing procedures

**Timeline**: When RTO/RPO requirements become stringent

## Development & Team Scaling

### Micro-Frontend Architecture
**Future Question**: Should we split frontend into independently deployable modules?
- Team independence
- Technology diversity
- **Impact**: Complex build and deployment processes

**Timeline**: When frontend team grows beyond 6 developers

### Advanced Testing Strategies
**Future Question**: Should we implement contract testing, property-based testing?
- Better integration testing
- Automated test generation
- **Impact**: Additional testing infrastructure and expertise

**Timeline**: When regression testing becomes burdensome

### Developer Self-Service Platform
**Future Question**: Should we build internal developer platform?
- Automated environment provisioning
- Self-service debugging tools
- **Impact**: Significant internal tooling investment

**Timeline**: When developer velocity is limited by operational overhead

## Cost Optimization

### Reserved Capacity Planning
**Future Question**: Should we optimize for reserved GCP capacity?
- Cost savings for predictable workloads
- Capacity planning complexity
- **Impact**: Financial commitment and usage prediction

**Timeline**: When monthly GCP costs exceed $5000

### Multi-Cloud Strategy

## Decision Framework for Future Items

**Criteria for Revisiting**:
1. **Customer Demand**: >25% of customers request feature
2. **Scale Threshold**: Technical limits of current approach
3. **Competitive Pressure**: Market forces require capability
4. **Team Growth**: Current architecture limits team productivity
5. **Cost Pressure**: Current approach becomes unsustainable

**Evaluation Process**:
1. Document current pain points and limitations
2. Research industry best practices and alternatives  
3. Prototype solution in non-production environment
4. Calculate implementation cost vs business benefit
5. Plan migration strategy with rollback options
6. Document decision rationale for future reference

**Success Criteria**: Future architecture decisions are data-driven and support sustainable business growth
