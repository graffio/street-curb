## Decision Process

**Current Status**: All user questions extracted from archive YAML into focused documents

**Next Steps**:
1. Review `decisions-needed-now.md` and classify each item as:
   - ðŸš« **True blocker** - Must decide now
   - âœ… **Defaultable** - Can use reasonable default, change later  
   - ðŸ”„ **Move to implementation-details** - Technical decision for during coding

2. Make firm decisions on true blockers only
3. Begin infrastructure code development using defaults from `implementation-details.md`

**Goal**: Unblock infrastructure development while capturing all important considerations for future reference.
