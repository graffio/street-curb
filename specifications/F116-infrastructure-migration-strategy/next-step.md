# Next Step: Extend Adapter Foundation Failure Tests

## Developer Implementation Task

Extend the existing `test/adapter-foundation.tap.js` with more sophisticated failure scenarios to systematically test every failure mode through increasing complexity.

## Context
The test file already has basic failure testing:
- Basic operation failures and missing commands
- Rollback function failures  
- Multi-adapter coordination (Alice succeeds → Bob fails → Alice rolls back)
- Complete round-trip rollback scenarios

We need to add more sophisticated failure scenarios to increase test coverage.

## File Changes Required

### test/adapter-foundation.tap.js
Add the following new test sections after the existing tests:

#### 1. Complex Multi-Step Failure Chains
```javascript
await t.test('Given three-adapter operation when second adapter fails then rollback occurs in reverse order', async t => {
    // Given: Alice, Bob, Charlie adapters with Bob configured to fail
    // When: executeSteps called with 3-step plan
    // Then: Alice executes → Bob fails → Alice rolls back, Charlie never executes
})

await t.test('Given rollback failure when forward operation also failed then both failures are reported', async t => {
    // Given: Adapter with failing command and failing rollback
    // When: executeSteps called and both forward and rollback fail  
    // Then: ExecutionResult contains both original error and rollback error
})
```

#### 2. Timeout and Network Failure Simulation  
```javascript
await t.test('Given command with long execution time when timeout reached then operation fails gracefully', async t => {
    // Given: Alice adapter with command that delays beyond timeout
    // When: executeSteps called with short timeout
    // Then: ExecutionResult shows timeout error, no system crash
})

await t.test('Given network failure during execution when command runs then failure is handled gracefully', async t => {
    // Given: Alice adapter with command that simulates network error
    // When: executeSteps called
    // Then: ExecutionResult shows network error, system remains stable
})
```

#### 3. Invalid Configuration Handling
```javascript
await t.test('Given malformed configuration when generatePlan called then plan generation fails with clear error', async t => {
    // Given: Configuration with invalid structure/types
    // When: generatePlan called with malformed config
    // Then: Error thrown with descriptive message, no plan types
})

await t.test('Given missing required fields when generatePlan called then validation fails early', async t => {
    // Given: Configuration missing required fields (e.g., no projectId)
    // When: generatePlan called
    // Then: Error thrown identifying missing fields, no plan types
})
```

#### 4. Resource Exhaustion Scenarios
```javascript
await t.test('Given memory-intensive operation when system under pressure then operation fails gracefully', async t => {
    // Given: Alice adapter simulating high memory usage
    // When: executeSteps called during simulated memory pressure
    // Then: ExecutionResult shows resource exhaustion error
})

await t.test('Given multiple concurrent executions when system overloaded then appropriate limits enforced', async t => {
    // Given: Multiple executeSteps calls running simultaneously
    // When: Concurrent execution limit exceeded
    // Then: Additional executions queued or rejected appropriately
})
```


### Implementation Notes
- Use the existing Alice/Bob adapter pattern for consistency
- Each test should follow the existing pattern: setup → execute → validate results
- Add appropriate error message assertions to validate failure modes
- Ensure all tests use the existing `InfrastructureAdapter` and `LookupTable` patterns
- Add timeout configurations where needed (use reasonable test timeouts like 100ms)

## Validation Commands
After implementation, run:
```bash
cd /Users/Shared/projects/row-canvas/modules/infrastructure-management
yarn test test/adapter-foundation.tap.js
```

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All existing tests continue to pass (143+ tests)
- [ ] New failure scenario tests added and passing
- [ ] Test coverage includes the 5 new categories listed above
- [ ] No test execution time significantly increased (under 5 seconds total)
- [ ] All new tests follow existing patterns and conventions

## Expected Outcome
Enhanced test suite with comprehensive failure mode coverage, providing confidence that the infrastructure system handles edge cases and failure scenarios gracefully.
