- Search for published CDS sample datasets; log sources or absence.
- If none, draft realistic fixtures per profile (valid and invalid pairs).
- Keep fixtures small but covering edge cases (time ordering, enums, coords).
- Decide fixture storage layout under modules/cli-cds-validator/fixtures/.
- Record any confidentiality/licensing notes for sourced data.
- Ensure fixtures illustrate only what the CLI can check offline (structure, profiles, intra-payload coherence) and avoid scenarios needing live API state.
