# LLM-First Development Summary

**Date:** 2025.07.25  
**Purpose:** Essential principles for LLM-first large codebase development

## Core Insight
LLMs need explicit, machine-readable context that humans maintain implicitly. Success requires inverting traditional priorities - documentation first, continuous validation, and predictive development.

## Critical Foundation: Type Safety
Type safety isn't optional - it's foundational infrastructure that enables all other LLM tooling. Without explicit type definitions, LLMs cannot understand relationships or perform safe refactoring.

## 10 Essential Programming Mindsets
1. **Type Safety in Typeless Languages** - @sig comments, PropTypes, tagged types
2. **Functional Programming** - Pure functions, immutability, composability  
3. **Comprehensive Testing** - Beyond unit tests to behavioral validation
4. **Explicit Over Implicit** - Document all assumptions and context
5. **Metadata-Driven Development** - Code metadata as first-class citizen
6. **Continuous Validation** - Constant checking, never assume compliance
7. **Contextual Persistence** - Externalized, queryable development context
8. **Predictive Development** - Analyze impact before making changes
9. **Compositional Architecture** - Small, well-defined, reusable parts
10. **Observable Systems** - Everything measurable and trackable

## Priority Implementation Order
1. **Critical:** Change impact prediction + type safety infrastructure
2. **High:** Documentation priority + architectural validation + regression testing
3. **Medium:** Proactive refactoring + decision logging + knowledge decay prevention
4. **Low:** Code quality evolution

## Success Criteria
LLMs can safely modify large codebases without breaking changes while maintaining consistent quality improvements.
