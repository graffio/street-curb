# Claude Session Onboarding

**Date:** 2025.07.27  
**Purpose:** Standard onboarding instructions for new Claude sessions

## Essential Reading Order
1. **@A001-coding-standards/implementation.md** - Core development standards
2. **@A002-agent-workflow-patterns/implementation.md** - Three-agent workflow system
3. **@A006-specification-standards/implementation.md** - Documentation structure

## Critical Constraints
- **Workflow**: Use three-agent sequence: tech-lead-complexity-reducer → tdd-implementer → code-reviewer
- **Commits**: Follow format in @A005-commit-format/


## Getting Started
1. Review current git status and recent commits
2. Use appropriate agent for next task type
