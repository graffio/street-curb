# Architecture Specifications

This folder contains high-level architectural specifications and refactoring plans for the row-canvas project.

## Purpose

These documents provide:
- **Architectural decisions** and their rationale
- **Refactoring plans** for improving code quality
- **Pattern definitions** for consistent development
- **LLM guidance** for maintaining and extending the codebase

## Specifications

### [Redux Refactoring Plan](./2025.01.22%20Redux%20Refactoring%20Plan.md)
**Status**: Planned  
**Priority**: High  
**Scope**: State management architecture

**Overview**: Comprehensive plan to refactor the Redux implementation for better LLM maintainability, including:
- Extracting business logic from reducers
- Standardizing error handling
- Improving selector consistency
- Adding comprehensive type documentation

**Key Goals**:
- Separate business logic from state management
- Create predictable, LLM-friendly APIs
- Improve error handling and debugging
- Standardize patterns across the codebase

## Usage for LLMs

When working on this project, LLMs should:

1. **Read relevant architecture specs** before making changes to affected areas
2. **Follow established patterns** defined in these specifications
3. **Reference refactoring plans** when improving existing code
4. **Update specifications** when making architectural changes

## Future Specifications

Planned architecture specifications:
- **Component Architecture** - Patterns for React component design
- **Testing Strategy** - Comprehensive testing approach
- **Performance Optimization** - Guidelines for performance improvements
- **Accessibility Standards** - Accessibility patterns and requirements

## Contributing

When adding new architecture specifications:
1. Use descriptive filenames with dates
2. Include clear problem statements and solutions
3. Provide concrete examples and code samples
4. Consider LLM maintainability in all recommendations
5. Update this README with new specifications
