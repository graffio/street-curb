# F105 Event Handling Unification Summary

**Date:** 2025.07.29  
**Purpose:** Eliminate duplicated touch/mouse event logic through unified event abstraction

## Core Decision
Create unified event handling system to replace duplicated touch/mouse implementations:
- **Event normalization** - Single utility to extract coordinates from touch/mouse events
- **Unified handlers** - Replace separate touch/mouse event handlers with combined logic
- **Preview consolidation** - Single drag preview system for both input types
- **Touch detection** - Runtime detection of touch capability instead of separate code paths

## Key Constraints
- **No behavior changes** - Maintain identical user experience for both input types
- **Performance** - No regression in drag operation responsiveness
- **Compatibility** - Support same browsers and devices as current implementation
- **Testing** - Both touch and mouse interactions must be testable
- **Incremental** - Apply changes component by component after F104 decomposition

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Eliminate ~200 lines of duplicated touch/mouse event code
- [ ] Single drag preview system handles both input types
- [ ] Touch and mouse interactions feel identical to users
- [ ] Event handling logic is testable with mocked events
- [ ] No regressions in mobile or desktop functionality

## Cross-References
- **Prerequisite**: @F104-component-decomposition - Must complete component extraction first
- **Standards**: @A001-coding-standards - Maintain functional patterns and single-level indentation
- **Next phase**: @F106-label-positioning-simplification - Simplified label collision system
