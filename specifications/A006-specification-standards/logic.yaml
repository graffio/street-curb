  description: >
    This document defines the structure and validation rules for all specifications
    used by LLMs in this system. Each spec must consist of modular files with defined roles.

files:
  - meta.yaml:
      role: system_metadata
      required: true
      fields:
        - spec_id: string
        - name: string
        - type: enum [feature, system, module, design]
        - status: enum [active, deprecated, draft]
        - files: list of file descriptors (see below)

  - llm-loader.md:
      role: llm_bootstrap
      required: true
      purpose: >
        Guides the LLM in how to load and interpret the spec. Includes file roles,
        loading order, and special instructions.

  - logic.yaml:
      role: implementation_rules
      required: true
      format: freeform YAML describing the system, behavior, data model, or constraints
      guideline: >
        Should avoid prose and use structured data whenever possible.
        Must define key inputs, outputs, and logic units.

  - tests.yaml:
      role: validation_suite
      required: false
      format: YAML list of test cases with clear input/expectation mapping
      guideline: Used to validate spec correctness, not runtime tests

  - overview.md:
      role: human_context
      required: false
      guideline: >
        Optional high-level summary. Should be brief and explanatory.
        Not loaded by default unless in documentation mode.

rules:
  - Each spec must contain at least:
      - meta.yaml
      - llm-loader.md
      - logic.yaml
  - All file names must be unique within the spec
  - Each file declared in meta.yaml must exist and match its declared role
  - Specs must be modular and loadable without prior context
