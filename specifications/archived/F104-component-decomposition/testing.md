# F104 Component Decomposition Testing

## Component-Level Testing

### DragDropHandler Tests
```javascript
// Test drag start events
- Mouse drag start sets draggingIndex correctly
- Touch drag start prevents default and sets drag data
- Drag events are ignored on divider elements

// Test drag operations  
- Segment reordering calls onSwap with correct indices
- Mobile drag preview updates position during touch move
- Drag end cleans up state properly

// Test edge cases
- Dragging to same position doesn't trigger swap
- Invalid drag data doesn't cause errors
```

### SegmentRenderer Tests  
```javascript
// Test visual rendering
- Segment width/height calculated correctly from total
- Background color matches segment type from COLORS constant
- isDragging applies correct CSS class

// Test event attachment
- Drag handlers are properly attached to segment element
- Touch events are handled for mobile support
```

### LabelLayer Tests
```javascript  
// Test label positioning
- Labels positioned at correct percentage based on segment midpoint
- Smart positioning offsets applied from props
- Label width uses uniform width when provided

// Test dropdown interactions
- Label click toggles editing state correctly  
- Type selection calls onChangeType with correct parameters
- "Add left" option calls onAddLeft with segment index
- Dropdown closes after selection
```

### DividerLayer Tests
```javascript
// Test divider positioning  
- Dividers positioned at cumulative segment boundaries
- No divider rendered after last segment when no unknown space
- Unknown space divider rendered when needed

// Test drag initiation
- onDirectDragStart called with correct event and index
- Divider styling includes proper cursor and touch-action
```

## Integration Testing

### Full Editor Functionality
```javascript
// Test complete workflows
- Add segment -> drag to reorder -> resize boundary -> change type
- Mobile touch interactions work end-to-end
- Label positioning updates after segment changes

// Test state synchronization  
- Redux state updates propagate to all child components
- Local UI state (dragging, editing) managed correctly
- No memory leaks from event handlers
```

## Regression Testing Checklist

### Visual Behavior
- [ ] Segments render with correct proportions and colors
- [ ] Labels position correctly without overlapping
- [ ] Dividers appear at proper segment boundaries
- [ ] Drag previews show during mobile interactions

### Interaction Behavior  
- [ ] Segment drag and drop reordering works (desktop + mobile)
- [ ] Boundary resizing via dividers functions properly
- [ ] Label dropdowns open and close correctly
- [ ] Type changes and "Add left" operations work

### Performance Behavior
- [ ] No additional re-renders compared to original component
- [ ] Drag operations feel responsive on mobile devices
- [ ] Label positioning calculations don't cause lag

## Testing Commands

### Unit Tests
```bash
npm test -- --testPathPattern=SegmentedCurbEditor
```

### Integration Tests  
```bash
npm test -- --testPathPattern=integration
```

### Visual Regression Tests (if available)
```bash
npm run test:visual
```

## Success Criteria Validation

### Code Organization
- SegmentedCurbEditor.jsx reduced from 700+ to under 150 lines
- Each component has single, clear responsibility  
- No circular dependencies between components

### Functionality Preservation
- All existing user interactions work identically
- Mobile touch support maintained
- Redux integration patterns unchanged
- No performance regressions observed

### Maintainability Improvement
- Components can be unit tested in isolation
- Clear separation of concerns between drag/render/label logic
- Easier to locate and fix specific interaction bugs
