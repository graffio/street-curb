# F106 Label Positioning Simplification Summary

**Date:** 2025.07.29  
**Purpose:** Replace complex collision detection system with modern CSS-based label positioning

## Core Decision
Eliminate manual collision detection and DOM measurements in favor of CSS-based solutions:
- **CSS Grid approach** - Use grid system for automatic label positioning without overlap
- **Container queries** - Let CSS handle responsive label sizing instead of JS measurements  
- **Flexbox fallback** - Support older browsers with flexbox-based positioning
- **Remove complex logic** - Eliminate ~100 lines of collision detection and measurement code

## Key Constraints
- **Visual parity** - Labels must position identically to current implementation
- **Performance improvement** - Reduce DOM measurements and layout thrashing
- **Browser support** - Maintain compatibility with existing browser requirements
- **Responsive behavior** - Labels adapt to different container sizes
- **Sequential application** - Apply after F104 component decomposition completion

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Remove collision detection logic from label-positioning.js (~60 lines)
- [ ] Eliminate DOM measurement code for width calculations (~25 lines)
- [ ] Labels position without overlapping using pure CSS
- [ ] Performance improvement in label positioning updates
- [ ] Fix bug where labels stack right instead of left when space available

## Cross-References
- **Prerequisite**: @F104-component-decomposition - Must extract LabelLayer component first
- **Bug fix**: Addresses label stacking issue mentioned in original problem statement
- **Standards**: @A001-coding-standards - Maintain functional patterns where JS logic remains
