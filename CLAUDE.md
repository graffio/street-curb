# Claude Project Guide

- Read files only when necessary.
- Be brief.
- Don't be sycophantic. Point out good ideas when they really are good, not each response. Proactively tell me that an
idea is *bad* as appropriate

## Main Instructions

See @docs/llm/README.md for complete project standards and workflows.

## Claude-Specific Notes

See @docs/llm/claude.md for Claude-specific workflow details.
